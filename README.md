# Full-stack Test Project

Create a simple registration website with state management.

## Objectives

/ Implement a simple registration website complete with a frontend and backend.

/ The website must have at least six sections: Register, Login, Step1, Step2, Step3, and Inside.

/ On first visit, the user must start at registration. They can choose to Login or Register at this stage.

/ If they Register, they should be able to create a new user by entering their preferred username and password
in the Register form. Once successful, they should be redirected to Step1. If they login, they should be Inside.

/ Step1, Step2, and Step3 are forms with at least one input. They are consecutive and mandatory,
i.e. users must not be able to go to Step2 without completing Step1.

- At any point of the steps, the user can go back and forth, and logout.
If they log back in, they should be at the **uncompleted** stage.

/ The Inside section should show all the user inputs in the steps.
